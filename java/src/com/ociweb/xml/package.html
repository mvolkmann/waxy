      This package provides a simple API for writing XML documents
      It is particularly well-suited to writing large XML documents
      because it doesn't require storing them in a DOM-like structure
      before outputting them.  XML libraries that use that approach can
      cause the JVM to run out of memory when outputting large XML documents.
